“The secret life of cells” by Michael Eisenstein was our first paper, an editorial piece with a coy and curious title. As if cells have an agenda to hide their molecular business. What kind of business does a cell have anyways? Cellular business  generally entails receiving, processing and responding to stimuli. Researchers have been trying to decode the processing language and its mechanisms since the discovery of cells in 1665 by Robert Hooke. With his candle lit microscope, Hooke described individual ‘miniaturized rooms’, which we know today as single cells. Single cell technology has evolved far from Hooke’s makeshift microscope, yet the desire to unveil the secrets of cells remains.

Eisenstein’s paper highlights emerging single cell multimodal methods and the people behind them. Instead of re-writing the paper, I will provide a table summary of the sequencing method, the scientist (I am crediting the people mentioned in the paper only. Please forgive me for missing the teams involved), the type of molecules measured and the type of experiments:
